# C++ Master

## Purpose:

The purpose of this project is to master the art of programming in C++
In detail:
1. Mastering native C++17 without STL
2. Mastering C++ with STL
3. Learn unit testing in C++
4. Learn to setup projects with CMAKE fo linux and Visual Studio for Windows

There are much better smarter programmers out there. I am hoping this repo will 
attract higher caliber programmers to improve the code implemented here.

This uses "How to cracl the programming Interview" for questions ideas.
