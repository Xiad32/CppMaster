# C++ Master

## Purpose:

The purpose of this project is to master the art of programming in C++
In detail:
1. Mastering native C++17 without STL
2. Mastering C++ with STL
3. Learn unit testing in C++
4. Learn to setup projects with CMAKE for linux and Visual Studio for Windows

There are much better smarter programmers out there. I am hoping this repo will 
attract higher caliber programmers to improve the code implemented here.

This uses "Cracking the Coding Interview" for questions ideas. The questions and 
and answers will not be shared anywhere in this repo.
